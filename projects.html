        <p class="m-3">Tech Connect is an extracurricular activity, which exposes students to unique applications of technology related to STEM topics and encourages them to think differently, connect differently and snatch opportunities coming their way. Through the
            club, students have a chance to develop crucial skills like critical thinking, decision making, curiosity, problem solving, leadership, innovation, acceptance of failure etc., enabling them to become more successful individuals in the future.
            Additionally, they develop a love of STEM and grow to be interested in STEM subjects and jobs in the future. Last year in Tech Connect, students explored various new and upcoming technologies and were exposed to the use of AI in various disciplines
            like art, design, language, music and more through programs such as GauGAN, a software that turns doodles into stunning, photorealistic landscapes; Thing Translator, a software that allows you to learn new languages using the camera on your
            phone; and Bach Harmoniser, a software that can harmonise your melodies and transform them into Bach's signature style! Additionally, students were taught about concepts such as machine learning, neural networks, supervised and unsupervised
            learning, reinforcement learning, NLP, NLU, NLG, latent space models etc.. Due to the success of this initiative, I have formed a team of around 10 students, so that this can be expanded to many ESF primary schools as well.</p>

        <p class="m-3">Being selected to act as a champion of Technovation Girls for this region, I feel that it is crucial to empower girls to change their perception of themselves, so that they view themselves as not only the users of technology, but as inventors,
            designers and entrepreneurs. The competition focuses on encouraging girls to solve real-world problems through technology. Through the competition, girls can get an insight into the problems faced by people in other countries, as well as interact
            with others on a global level. With this role, I am have recruited participants and am currently hosting events to explain my first-hand experience of participating in the competition. I will be motivating and supporting participants throughout
            the program and recruiting girls from underserved communities as well.
